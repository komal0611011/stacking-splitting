# NumPy Topic 6 â€“ Stacking & Splitting Arrays

This repository contains practice code and solutions for **Topic 6 of NumPy learning**, focused on **Stacking and Splitting Arrays** â€“ an important topic for data shaping in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering.

---

## âœ… Topics Covered

- `np.vstack()` â€“ Vertical stacking
- `np.hstack()` â€“ Horizontal stacking
- `np.dstack()` â€“ Depth-wise stacking
- `np.stack()` â€“ General stacking with custom axis
- `np.concatenate()` â€“ Flexible array joining
- `np.split()` â€“ Split 1D array into equal parts
- `np.vsplit()` â€“ Vertical split of 2D arrays (row-wise)
- `np.hsplit()` â€“ Horizontal split of 2D arrays (column-wise)

---

## ðŸ“˜ Practice Highlights

- Stacked 1D and 2D arrays using `vstack`, `hstack`, and `dstack`
- Used `stack()` with different `axis` value
